# summerhacks-react

-   ReactJS for front end ui
-   Material UI library for some components
-   React-router for routing in SPA
-   axios for http requests
-   JWT for authorization

# TODO

-   uhh why is password's hash returned during register's api?
-   currently the token is stored in localStorage - this is kinda insecure but easy to use.
-   CORS problem is temporarily fixed using https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
Make sure to run `npm install`
